#Data Challenge 2 Group 5

This is the repository used to obtain all analyses, models, and dashboards that were presented.

1. Run 'pip install -r requirements.txt' to download all package dependancies.
2. Run the 'initialize_db.py' file. This will create a sqlite database structure.
3. Run the 'download_data.py' file. This will pull the archive of the metropolitan police incident reports that are available at the time of you running it.

Once this is run, you will be able to freely interact with the jupyter notebooks, model, and dashboard. 

To run the dashboard, run 'app.py'.
The model and dashboard content is contained within the folder 'dashboard_app.py'

Independant analyses are contained within  the folder 'Jupyter Notebooks Analyses'.
